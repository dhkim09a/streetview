%\oursubsection{Google Street View}
\oursubsection{OpenSURF}
Speeded Up Robust Feature, SURF\cite{surf}, is an image searching algorithm which is robust to rotation, scaling, distortion, brightness change and covering.
SURF selects interesting points and extract feature which is 64-dimensional vector describes interesting point and nearby pixels.
OpenSURF\cite{opensurf} is an open-source SURF library based on openCV\cite{opencv}.
\name{} use it to extract features from images.

\oursubsection{Vector Matching}
Needle and haystack denote a set of feature vectors extracted from an image we are looking for and taget images of searching, respectively.
Finding a needle from a haystack is done by vector matching.
A vector of haystack which has the smallest eucladian distance with a vector of needle is selected as matched vector for that vector of needle.
It is allowd to match one vector of haystack with two or more different vectors of needle however this happens very rarely because haystack is typically more than $10^3$ times larget than needle.
